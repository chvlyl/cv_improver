- Designed and optimized agent model serving for high-throughput, low-latency deployments; implemented advanced model lifecycle/version management, custom API endpoints, and operational best practices for cloud environments.
- Led incident response and ongoing maintenance for live deployments, including automated monitoring, anomaly detection, and detailed incident runbooks.
- Developed and documented contributor guidelines, model architecture notes, and best practices for integrating GenAI agents with external platforms and pipelines.
- Drove initiatives on responsible AI: bias tracking/mitigation, safe deployment, contributor education, and user privacy in open-source agent frameworks.

**Embedchain – Core Contributor**  
2023–Present  
- Architected personalized GenAI solutions leveraging advanced RAG pipelines, model abstractions, and secure data preprocessing.
- Established MLOps standards for accuracy tracking, hallucination detection, and automated feedback loops to improve model outcomes in production.
- Created guides and documentation enhancing transparency and community onboarding around AI model deployments.

**Clearbit (acquired by HubSpot) – Senior Engineer, Project Lead**  
2018–2022  
- Led cross-functional teams to build, deploy, and manage AI/ML data enrichment solutions at enterprise scale; hands-on with cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and scalable inference endpoints.
- Acted as LLMOps champion: managed model version control, retraining schedules, performance benchmarking, and stakeholder updates on production model status.
- Initiated monitoring/alerting frameworks for deployments; led incident management, resolution, and knowledge sharing for technical teams.
- Collaborated extensively with product, data science, and engineering stakeholders to align business needs, translate requirements to technical designs, and ensure ethical AI deployment.

**Multiple Open Source/Startup Roles (Gioco, Sigma, ActiveModel Serializers, Machinery, Keeper)**  
2008–2018  
- Founded, led, or contributed to high-impact open-source projects now used in global enterprise and startup environments.
- Built, maintained, and documented robust data workflows (from ingestion through storage/archival) and real-time API solutions.
- Advocated for and enforced AI/ML product standards, reproducibility, and modularity to support long-term code reliability and maintainability.
